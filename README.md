# CloudClearingAPI: Land Development Investment Intelligence

### What is CloudClearingAPI?

Investing in land development is challenging. Information is scattered, opportunities are hard to spot, and it's difficult to know if development activity translates into a profitable venture.

CloudClearingAPI solves this by acting as an **automated investment analyst**. It scans regions across Indonesia, transforming satellite imagery and market data into clear, actionable investment intelligence.

**This system empowers you to:**
* **üìç Pinpoint Development Hotspots:** Automatically detect where land is being cleared and construction is happening *right now*.
* **üí∞ Evaluate Financial Viability:** Go beyond just activity to see **projected ROI**, **estimated land values**, and **development costs** based on live market data.
* **üèóÔ∏è Assess Real-World Viability:** Understand if a region has the roads, ports, and other critical infrastructure needed to support growth.
* **üìä Make Data-Driven Decisions:** Receive a single, comprehensive investment score (0-100) and a detailed PDF report that summarizes everything you need to know.

## ‚ú® The Scoring Philosophy: From Activity to Opportunity

Our scoring system is designed to answer two fundamental questions every investor asks:

1.  **Where is the activity?** (The Activity Score)
2.  **Is this activity a profitable opportunity?** (The Financial & Contextual Multipliers)

The final score is a blend of these elements, ensuring that we recommend not just *busy* areas, but *valuable* ones.

**Final Score** = (Activity Score) √ó (Infrastructure Multiplier) √ó (Market Multiplier) √ó (Confidence Score)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Scoring Works

### Part 1: The Activity Score (0-40 Points) - *Finding the Action*

This is the foundation of our analysis and is derived **entirely from satellite imagery**. It's our 'eye in the sky' that tells us where physical change is happening on the ground. We compare images from the last 7 days to the previous 7 days to find new development.

* **What We Look For:**
    * **Vegetation Loss (High Weight):** Forests or fields being cleared, a strong signal of future construction.
    * **New Construction (Highest Weight):** New buildings and urban areas appearing.
    * **Land Preparation (Medium Weight):** Bare earth being exposed for site preparation.

A region with significant, recent construction activity will receive the highest base scores.

### Part 2: Financial & Contextual Multipliers - *Is It a Good Deal?*

High activity is meaningless if the investment doesn't make financial sense. These multipliers adjust the Activity Score based on real-world financial and logistical factors.

#### üèóÔ∏è **The Infrastructure Multiplier (0.8x - 1.3x)**
This multiplier answers: "Can this area support new development?" It assesses the quality of surrounding infrastructure from OpenStreetMap.

* **Note on Accuracy:** This component was recently overhauled to provide a more realistic analysis. It now correctly models the concept of **diminishing returns**‚Äîthe first highway provides immense value, while the tenth adds much less.

| Infrastructure Score | Tier | Multiplier | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **90-100** | Excellent | **1.30x** | World-class infrastructure, major hub. |
| **75-89** | Very Good | **1.15x** | Strong logistical and transport links. |
| **60-74** | Good | **1.00x** | Adequate for standard development. |
| **40-59** | Fair | **0.90x** | Basic infrastructure, potential limitations. |
| **< 40** | Poor | **0.80x** | Weak or missing infrastructure. |

#### üí∞ **The Market Multiplier (0.85x - 1.40x)**
This is our most powerful feature. To determine the market context, we use a **cascading data system**:
1.  **Live Web Scraping:** First, we attempt to scrape live land prices from top Indonesian real estate portals like `Lamudi.co.id` and `Rumah.com`.
2.  **Cached Data:** If a live scrape isn't possible, we use data cached within the last 24-48 hours.
3.  **Regional Benchmarks:** As a final fallback, we use our internal database of historical price trends.

This live data feeds our **Market Multiplier**, which rewards regions with strong economic fundamentals.

| Annual Price Trend | Tier | Multiplier | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **> 15%** | Booming | **1.40x** | Exceptional, high-growth market. |
| **8-15%** | Strong | **1.20x** | Very healthy market with strong demand. |
| **2-8%** | Stable | **1.00x** | Steady, sustainable growth. |
| **0-2%** | Stagnant | **0.95x** | Slow growth, limited momentum. |
| **< 0%** | Declining | **0.85x** | Market is contracting. |

### Part 3: The Reality Check (Confidence Score)

This score ensures our system is honest about the quality of its own data. A low confidence score will reduce the final investment score, preventing us from making a strong recommendation based on incomplete information.

* **How it's calculated:** It's a weighted average of our confidence in each data source:
    * **Satellite Data (50% weight):** Higher confidence with recent, cloud-free images.
    * **Infrastructure Data (30% weight):** Highest with live OSM data, lower with regional fallbacks.
    * **Market Data (20% weight):** Highest with live-scraped prices, lowest with static benchmarks.

For a complete breakdown of the formulas and data sources, see our full [Technical Scoring Documentation](TECHNICAL_SCORING_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## üìä System Output: The Investment Report

The primary output is a multi-page PDF report that provides a comprehensive overview of each region.

* **Page 1: Executive Summary:** Highlights the top investment opportunities and summary statistics.
* **Region Detail Pages:** Each region gets its own detailed analysis, including:
    1.  **Final Recommendation:** A clear **‚úÖ BUY**, **‚ö†Ô∏è WATCH**, or **üî¥ PASS** rating.
    2.  **Score & Confidence:** The final score and the data confidence percentage.
    3.  **Financial Projection Summary:** The most valuable section, detailing **ROI projections**, **land value estimates**, total investment costs, and key risks.
    4.  **Satellite Imagery:** A grid of 5 images showing before/after, vegetation loss, and new construction hotspots.
    5.  **Infrastructure Details:** A list of nearby highways, ports, and airports.
    6.  **Development Activity Analysis:** A breakdown of detected activity (e.g., 60% Land Clearing, 40% Active Construction).

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Earth Engine Authentication Failed:**
```bash
earthengine authenticate
python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize(); print('‚úÖ Success')"
```

**OSM API Timeouts:**  
Increase timeout in `config.yaml`: `infrastructure.api_timeout: 60`

**Memory Errors:**  
Reduce resolution: `satellite.image_scale: 30` (from 10)

**No Satellite Images Found:**
- Increase `max_cloud_coverage` threshold
- Check region coordinates are within Sentinel-2 coverage

For detailed troubleshooting, see **[TECHNICAL_SCORING_DOCUMENTATION.md](TECHNICAL_SCORING_DOCUMENTATION.md)**.
