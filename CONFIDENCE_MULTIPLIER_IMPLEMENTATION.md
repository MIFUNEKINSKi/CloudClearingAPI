# Confidence Multiplier Non-Linear Implementation

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Version:** 2.4.1  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

---

## Summary

Implemented the non-linear confidence multiplier algorithm as documented in `TECHNICAL_SCORING_DOCUMENTATION.md`. This replaces the old linear formula with a more sophisticated approach that:

1. **Penalizes poor data quality more severely** (quadratic scaling below 85%)
2. **Rewards excellent data quality** (linear scaling above 85%)
3. **Uses component-level bonuses** (prevents post-aggregation inflation)
4. **Strengthens penalties** (-10% for <60% confidence vs old -5% for <70%)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**`src/core/corrected_scoring.py`:**
- **Lines ~120-145:** Updated confidence multiplier calculation with non-linear formula
- **Lines ~360-408:** Refactored `_calculate_confidence()` method to use component-level bonuses
- **Line 143:** Fixed variable name from `confidence_adjustment` to `confidence_multiplier`

### Key Changes

#### 1. Non-Linear Confidence Multiplier (Lines ~120-145)

**OLD (Linear Formula):**
```python
confidence_adjustment = 0.7 + (confidence * 0.3)  # Range: 0.7-1.0
final_score = after_market * confidence_adjustment
```

**NEW (Non-Linear Formula):**
```python
if confidence >= 0.85:
    # Linear scaling above 85%: 0.97 to 1.00
    confidence_multiplier = 0.97 + (confidence - 0.85) * 0.30
elif confidence >= 0.50:
    # Quadratic scaling between 50% and 85%: 0.70 to 0.97
    normalized_conf = (confidence - 0.50) / 0.35
    confidence_multiplier = 0.70 + 0.27 * (normalized_conf ** 1.2)
else:
    # Below 50% confidence: apply floor of 0.70
    confidence_multiplier = 0.70

# Clamp to ensure bounds (0.70 to 1.00)
confidence_multiplier = max(0.70, min(1.00, confidence_multiplier))
final_score = after_market * confidence_multiplier
```

#### 2. Component-Level Quality Bonuses (Lines ~360-408)

**OLD (Post-Aggregation Bonuses):**
```python
# Base confidence by source count
if available_sources == 3:
    base_confidence = 0.75
elif available_sources == 2:
    base_confidence = 0.60
else:
    base_confidence = 0.40

# Apply bonuses AFTER aggregation (could inflate)
if market_confidence >= 0.8:
    base_confidence *= 1.05  # +5% bonus
```

**NEW (Component-Level Bonuses):**
```python
# Apply bonuses BEFORE aggregation (prevents inflation)
if data_availability['market_data'] and market_confidence >= 0.85:
    market_confidence = min(0.95, market_confidence + 0.05)

if data_availability['infrastructure_data'] and infra_confidence >= 0.85:
    infra_confidence = min(0.95, infra_confidence + 0.05)

# Weighted average by availability
if available_sources == 3:
    overall_confidence = (
        0.40 * satellite_confidence +
        0.30 * infra_confidence +
        0.30 * market_confidence
    )
# ... (other cases)

# Strengthened penalty for very poor data
if overall_confidence < 0.60:
    overall_confidence *= 0.90  # -10% penalty
```

## Validation Results

### Test: `test_confidence_multiplier.py`

**All 8 test cases PASSED ✅**

| Confidence | OLD Multiplier | NEW Multiplier | Difference | Impact |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 50% | 0.8500 | 0.7000 | -0.1500 | **-17.6%** (stronger penalty) |
| 60% | 0.8800 | 0.7600 | -0.1200 | **-13.6%** (stronger penalty) |
| 70% | 0.9100 | 0.8379 | -0.0721 | **-7.9%** (moderate penalty) |
| 75% | 0.9250 | 0.8803 | -0.0447 | -4.8% |
| 80% | 0.9400 | 0.9244 | -0.0156 | -1.7% |
| 85% | 0.9550 | 0.9700 | +0.0150 | **+1.6%** (reward for excellence) |
| 90% | 0.9700 | 0.9850 | +0.0150 | **+1.5%** (reward for excellence) |
| 95% | 0.9850 | 1.0000 | +0.0150 | **+1.5%** (reward for excellence) |

### Key Observations

1. **Steeper Penalties Below 85%:**
   - 50% confidence: -17.6% penalty (was -15%)
   - 60% confidence: -13.6% penalty (was -12%)
   - 70% confidence: -7.9% penalty (was -9%)

2. **Small Rewards Above 85%:**
   - 85% confidence: +1.6% bonus (was -4.5%)
   - 90% confidence: +1.5% bonus (was -3.0%)
   - 95% confidence: +1.5% bonus (was -1.5%)

3. **Smooth Transition at 85% Threshold:**
   - 84% confidence: 0.9608 multiplier
   - 85% confidence: 0.9700 multiplier
   - 86% confidence: 0.9730 multiplier

## Impact on Investment Scoring

### Example: Region with 35/40 Satellite Score

**Scenario:**
- Satellite Development Score: 35/40
- Infrastructure Multiplier: 1.15x
- Market Multiplier: 1.05x
- Base calculation: 35 × 1.15 × 1.05 = 42.3 points

**OLD System (70% Confidence):**
- Linear multiplier: 0.91
- Final score: 42.3 × 0.91 = **38.5/100**
- Recommendation: **WATCH**

**NEW System (70% Confidence):**
- Non-linear multiplier: 0.838
- Final score: 42.3 × 0.838 = **35.4/100**
- Recommendation: **WATCH** (but with clearer penalty for data quality)

**Impact:** Scores are more conservative when data quality is questionable, preventing over-confidence in uncertain situations.

## Design Rationale

### Why Non-Linear Scaling?

1. **Real-World Decision Making:**
   - Investors don't trust 60% confidence data linearly
   - The difference between 60% and 70% is LARGER than between 85% and 95%
   - Quadratic scaling (x^1.2) reflects this psychological reality

2. **Risk Management:**
   - Poor data quality should significantly reduce investment scores
   - Linear penalties were too lenient (60% confidence only lost 12%)
   - New system: 60% confidence loses 24% (doubled penalty)

3. **Quality Incentive:**
   - System now rewards high-quality data sources
   - 95% confidence reaches perfect 1.00 multiplier (was 0.985)
   - Encourages investment in better data collection

### Why Component-Level Bonuses?

1. **Prevents Inflation:**
   - OLD: 3 sources at 80% each → 75% base × 1.05 × 1.05 = 82.7%
   - NEW: 3 sources at 80% each → weighted avg = 76% (no double-counting)

2. **More Accurate:**
   - Bonuses apply to individual data sources, not aggregated confidence
   - Reflects that one excellent source doesn't make all data excellent

3. **Transparent:**
   - Clear calculation path: bonus → weighted avg → penalty
   - No multiplicative compounding that's hard to explain

## Monitoring Run Comparison

The current monitoring run (started 12:18:06) is using the **OLD linear formula** because it started before implementation.

**Next monitoring run will use NEW non-linear formula:**
- Expected to show more conservative scores for regions with data quality issues
- Expected to show slightly higher scores for regions with excellent data (85%+ confidence)
- Overall distribution should shift toward more realistic risk assessment

**Recommendation:** Run side-by-side comparison after this implementation to validate improvements.
